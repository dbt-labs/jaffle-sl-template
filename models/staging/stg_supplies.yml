      List of our supply expenses data with basic cleaning and transformation applied.

      One row per supply cost, not per supply. As supply costs fluctuate they receive a new row with a new UUID. Thus there can be multiple rows per supply_id.
    columns:
      - name: supply_uuid
        description: The unique key of our supplies per cost.
